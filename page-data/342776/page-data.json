The town plan was developed in 1947-1950 under the direction of the town planning director architect Sven Markelius. The idea was to build a new kind of district that would not become a sleeping city but become a so-called ABC city with workplaces, housing and the center in the same area. As Sweden's first ABC city, Vällingby received a lot of attention, even internationally. The settlement in Vällingby is characterized by a careful adaptation to the landscape and an architecture with many fine details. The center of Vällingby was inaugurated in the fall of 1954, and during the years 2004-2008 underwent a major renovation and modernization. In the spring of 2008, the new center, which has now been named Vällingby City, was inaugurated. One of the new buildings, K-five designed by Gert Wingårdh,</p>\n<h2>Communication</h2>\n<p>In the immediate area there are very good communications. Bus 118 takes you to Spånga C and bus 179 takes you to both Spånga and Kista. The metro's green line takes about 28 minutes to Stockholm Central. 11 different bus lines run from Vällingby's bus terminal. By bus 179 you are in Spånga in about 11 minutes. There is a connection to the commuter train which will take you to Stockholm Central in 13 minutes.</p>","excerpt":"Description High up Gavelläge Walk-in closet Well-maintained tenant-owner association 2 min to Vällingby C The apartment is located in…","frontmatter":{"address":"Duvedsvägen 17, Vällingby Centrum","price":1895000,"floorplan":{"id":"b466d18e-9de9-5a6c-90ce-b15d51131b33","childImageSharp":{"id":"62fa997e-7207-57c8-9b2d-b68da4dc4870","resize":{"src":"/static/e559863dc165b51065984e4ba3024f47/9d169/floorplan.jpg"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.0765027322404372,"src":"/static/e559863dc165b51065984e4ba3024f47/04e66/floorplan.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e559863dc165b51065984e4ba3024f47/81890/floorplan.jpg 197w,\n/static/e559863dc165b51065984e4ba3024f47/b7e42/floorplan.jpg 393w,\n/static/e559863dc165b51065984e4ba3024f47/04e66/floorplan.jpg 615w","sizes":"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"details":"/342776/"}}}
